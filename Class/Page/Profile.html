          <h2>INTRODUCE MYSELT</h2>
          I’m currently working for a multinational company based in the United
          States and one of the things I had to go through was an English
          assessment during my interview. So, I know that interviews in a
          foreign language have that extra element of anxiety, because it’s not
          only about our job skills. But the good news is that designing a
          well-crafted and compelling introduction in English will pave the way
          and give you the confidence and ease you need to make a good
          impression during your interview.

              Introductions will always be awkward if you don’t know what to
              say. In short, don't get caught unprepared! So make sure you take
              the time to write down some introduction samples in English for
              different scenarios and practice them until you master them. I
              hope that today’s tips have helped you! If you have any questions,
